    </h2>

    <p>
      As the customer has failed the IDV check, you must:
    </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>tell the customer that you are ending the call, <strong>and</strong></li>
        <li>ask the customer to call back when they have access to the correct information, <strong>or</strong></li>
        <li>give the customer the option to write in and make sure they have the correct address if they do not wish to call back.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Customers have two separate attempts to pass the IDV check. If they fail on the second attempt, seek advice from your team leader.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        If this is their second failed IDV check
      </h2>

      <p>
        You must record this outcome in the relevant service line system.
      </p>

      <p>
        A bogus call report must be considered and sent as appropriate to the relevant security group inbox.

      </p>

      <p>
        You should use your judgement to decide whether any alternative arrangements can be made, for example:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>an outbound call</li>
        <li>face to face, for example a visit or a check at the office</li>
        <li>requests for documents to be sent by post</li>
